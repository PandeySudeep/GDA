# Does Gaussian Discriminant Analysis perform better than Logistic Regression?

## Overview

When we have a classification problem in which the input features x are continuous-valued random variables, we can then use the Gaussian Discrim- inant Analysis (GDA) model, which models p(x|y) using a multivariate nor- mal distribution. The model is:
