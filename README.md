# Does Gaussian Discriminant Analysis perform better than Logistic Regression?

## Overview

I took two sets of data - one with Multivariate Gaussian Distribution and another non-gaussian. I then modeled linear classifier on both the sets with Gaussian Discriminant Analysis as well as Logistic Regression.

### GDA on gaussian data:

### Logistic Regression on gaussian data:

#### Okay

### GDA on non-gaussian data:

### Logistic Regression on non-gaussian data:
